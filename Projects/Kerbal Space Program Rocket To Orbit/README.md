# KSP-kRPC-Python
This contains the code to make a rocket launch and a rocket stage land relatively unharmed in the ocean afterwards. 
This project is complete and in order to launch the rocket, you'll need to use the RocketLaunch.py file.
An experimental version of this project designed to send a rocket to Mars is being built in the ExperimentalRocketLaunch.py file.
